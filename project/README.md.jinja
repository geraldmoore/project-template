## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync
```

## Development

This project uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner. Run `just` to see all available commands:

```bash
just          # list available commands
just check    # run all checks (lint, typecheck, test)
just lint     # run ruff linter
just format   # format code with ruff
just test     # run tests
just test-cov # run tests with coverage
```

## Settings

Settings are managed with [pydantic-settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/) and loaded from environment variables and the `.env` file.

```python
from {{ module_name }}.core.config import get_settings

settings = get_settings()
print(settings.environment)  # "local", "staging", or "production"
print(settings.is_production)
```

To add new settings, extend the `Settings` class in `{{ module_name }}/core/config/settings.py`:

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    environment: Environment = Environment.LOCAL
    my_new_setting: str = "default"
```

Then set the value via environment variable or `.env`:

```bash
MY_NEW_SETTING=value
```
{%- endif %}
{%- if setup_logging %}

## Logging

Call `setup_logging` inside any startup scripts:

```python
from {{ module_name }}.core.config import setup_logging

setup_logging()
```

This configures coloured console output. Pass a custom level if needed:

```python
import logging

setup_logging(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
{%- endif %}
