## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync
```

## Development

This project uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner. Run `just` to see all 
available commands:

```bash
just               # list available commands
just check         # run all checks (lint, typecheck, test)
just format        # Format code with ruff (applies fixes)
just format-check  # Run ruff formatter check (without fixes)
just install       # Install dependencies and prek hooks
just lint          # Run ruff linter
just prek          # Run all prek hooks
just prek-install  # Install prek git hooks
just test *args    # Run tests
just test-cov      # Run tests with coverage
just typecheck     # Run ty type checker
```
{%- if setup_settings %}

The project also uses [`prek`](https://prek.j178.dev/) for pre-commit hook management. These hooks 
automatically apply format and type checks on `git` commits only (not on the entire codebase). This 
ensures all committed code follows pre-defined standards, whilst the rest of the codebase can maintain
development flexibility. 

If you prefer to keep everything up to standard, use `just check` or the individual `just format` or 
`just lint` commands to run on the entire codebase.

## Settings

Settings are managed with [pydantic-settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/) 
with values loaded from environment variables (priority) or a `.env` file (fallback).

```python
from {{ module_name }}.core.config import get_settings

settings = get_settings()
print(settings.environment)  # "local", "staging", or "production"
print(settings.is_production)
```

To add new settings, extend the `Settings` class in `{{ module_name }}/core/config/settings.py`:

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    environment: Environment = Environment.LOCAL
    my_new_setting: str = "default"
```

Then set the value via environment variable (priorty) or `.env` (fallback):

```bash
MY_NEW_SETTING=value
```
{%- endif %}
{%- if setup_logging %}

## Logging

Call `setup_logging` inside any startup scripts:

```python
from {{ module_name }}.core.config import setup_logging

setup_logging()
```

This configures coloured console output. Pass a custom level if needed:

```python
import logging

setup_logging(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
{%- endif %}
